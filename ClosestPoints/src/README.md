  This program finds the closest pair of points relative to the x- y- coordinates withing a set. This was an assignment in which we were given an outline of what the program should accomplish and then we had to implement the classes and methods. This was a great exercise to develop a better understanding of overloaded methods and drivers. 
 The program creates an array of Point Objects and a two dimensional array of double values(which is used to create an array of Points when passed as an arg), both of which are intialized with random values. Both arrays can be used as args for the getClosestPair() which returns a Pair Object containing the two Points that are nearest eachother on an x- y- plane. The program also keeps track of how long the getClosetPair() takes to complete.
